Abstract: This study explores the application of dynamic chaos models and self-organization through artificial intelligence in managing market asset observations. Key findings demonstrate the effectiveness of channel management strategies in dynamic market environments, supported by statistical evidence and visual representations. The implications suggest the need for adaptive computing schemes and fast self-organizing systems to enhance management stability. 

Introduction: Theoretical framework addresses the chaotic nature of market asset observations and inefficiency of traditional statistical approaches. Research aims to develop effective management strategies using dynamic chaos models and self-organization through artificial intelligence. 

Methods: The methodology focuses on robustifying forecasting algorithms and management decisions to minimize sensitivity to dynamic and statistical variations. It employs adaptive computing schemes and sequential adaptation strategies to enhance stability in uncertain market conditions. Statistical validation emphasizes the unpredictability of market asset value changes and challenges posed by dynamic chaos, highlighting the importance of numerical validation. 

Results: Key findings present the performance of channel management strategies in dynamic markets, supported by statistical evidence. Network approximations and visual representations illustrate the complexity of management decisions under chaotic dynamics. 

Discussion: Interpretation of results emphasizes the need for adaptive decision-making algorithms and robustification techniques to improve stability. Theoretical and practical implications include the application of artificial intelligence for self-organization in managing dynamic market processes. Research limitations acknowledge the challenges posed by chaotic dynamics and suggest future directions for enhancing management strategies. 

Conclusion: The study advocates for dynamic adaptation of decision-making algorithms and the use of artificial intelligence for self-organization to improve management stability in chaotic market dynamics. Future research should focus on implementing robustification techniques and fast self-organizing systems to address these challenges.
