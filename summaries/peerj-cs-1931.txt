### **Trading Strategy Summary**  

#### **Core Strategy**  
The strategy employs **OW-XGBoost**, a machine learning-based model that integrates multiple return and risk indicators using **fusing labels with optimal weights**. It focuses on large-cap stocks with strong liquidity and industry balance, primarily trading stocks from indices such as **CSI 300, CSI 100, and CSI 800**. The model uses a **sliding window approach** to retain time-series characteristics and improve predictive accuracy.  

#### **Stock Selection**  
- **Focus on large-cap stocks** due to higher liquidity and lower susceptibility to price manipulation.  
- **Excludes ST stocks** and those **listed for less than six months** to avoid unreliable data.  
- **Avoids short-selling**, as it is challenging in the Chinese market.  

#### **Trade Signals**  
- The model identifies **buy opportunities** based on a combination of return metrics (rate of return, excess return) and risk controls (volatility, drawdown).  
- **No short-selling** is considered.  
- Trades are executed when conditions align with the optimized fusing labels, ensuring a balance between risk and return.

### **Risk Management Rules**  

#### **Stop Loss & Position Sizing**  
- The strategy controls risk through **maximum drawdown limits**, ensuring losses do not exceed predefined thresholds.  
- Position sizing is dynamically adjusted based on **Sharpe ratio and volatility metrics**, favoring stocks with **higher risk-adjusted returns**.  

#### **Exit Conditions**  
- Positions are closed based on a combination of **return and risk thresholds**, ensuring that excessive volatility does not erode gains.  
- **Monthly rebalancing** is preferred over weekly adjustments to reduce transaction costs and improve stability.  

#### **Additional Constraints**  
- **Leverage is not explicitly mentioned**, but the model prioritizes **low-volatility stocks** to maintain stability.  
- The strategy consistently **outperforms traditional benchmarks** such as CSI 300, exhibiting **lower volatility and drawdowns** while maintaining high returns.  

**Conclusion:**  
OW-XGBoost provides a robust, **machine-learning-driven approach** to stock selection, balancing **high returns with controlled risk**. It is particularly effective in stable and turbulent markets but may experience **drawdowns during extreme market crashes**.
