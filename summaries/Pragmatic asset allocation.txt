Abstract: This research explores the integration of macro factors in investment strategies to improve portfolio performance, focusing on the yield curve's role in reducing volatility and enhancing risk-adjusted returns. The study uses a comprehensive approach combining momentum, trend, cash, and the yield curve to optimize portfolio outcomes. Statistical analysis supports the strategy's effectiveness, showing a decrease in volatility and an increase in the Sharpe ratio. The findings suggest that integrating macro factors leads to improved portfolio performance.

Introduction: Theoretical framework emphasizes the importance of macro factors in portfolio management, specifically the yield curve, to enhance risk-adjusted returns. Research aims to demonstrate how including the yield curve in investment strategies can lead to better performance. The theoretical foundation underscores the significance of a comprehensive strategy integrating various macroeconomic indicators.

Methods: The methodology integrates momentum, trend, cash, and the yield curve to optimize portfolio performance. Statistical approaches include analyzing the equity curve, maximum drawdown, and performance summary of the combined strategy. Validation methods ensure the robustness of the employed strategy.

Results: Key findings indicate a reduction in portfolio volatility and an increase in the Sharpe ratio when incorporating the yield curve in investment strategies. Data visualizations demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness in enhancing risk-adjusted returns.

Discussion: Interpretation focuses on the implications of the results for portfolio management, highlighting the benefits of integrating macro factors. Theoretical and practical implications emphasize the importance of considering macroeconomic indicators in investment decision-making. Research limitations include the need for exploring synergies between different macro factors for further insights.

Conclusion: The study underscores the value of integrating macro factors such as the yield curve to improve portfolio performance. Future research should investigate the combined effect of multiple macro factors and their long-term implications on investment strategies.
