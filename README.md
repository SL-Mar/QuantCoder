# QuantCoder FS 

## Overview

QuantCoder is a full-stack application that leverages FastAPI on the backend and CrewAI for orchestrating various LLM-powered agents to perform tasks such as summarization, coding, fundamentals analysis, and more.

> **Important:**  
> The previous version of this project has been moved to the `quantcoder-legacy` branch. The main branch is now reserved for developing the new version of QuantCoder from scratch.

## Legacy Version

The initial release, known as **QuantCoder**, is preserved in the `quantcoder-legacy` branch. It contains the original implementation along with its technical documentation. Please refer to that branch if you need to review the previous architecture or implementation details.

## New Project Roadmap

- **Current Focus:**  
  The first workflow (e.g., summarization) is being rebuilt on the main branch as the foundation for the new version.

- **Future Workflows:**  
  Additional workflows (Fundamentals, Research, Coding, etc.) will be integrated incrementally. Each new release will be documented in detail via Medium articles and updated release notes in this repository.

- **Goals:**  
  - Improve code modularity and maintainability.
  - Enhance scalability for adding or modifying workflows.
  - Foster community collaboration through clear documentation and a structured codebase.

## Technical Documentation (Pre-Open Source Release)

The technical documentation of the application is available at :
[**QuantCoder_FS documentation**](https://medium.com/@sl_mar/quantcoder-fs-documentation-6fc79915e287?sk=1013c8e27cd8113ddeb8259b1ddf1939)

which outlines the architecture and design principles. 
This documentation serves as a reference for the new development efforts.

## Licence

To be defined at a later stage.
